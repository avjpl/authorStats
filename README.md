# authorStats

Fetch the daily/weekly/monthly download stats for all your NPM packages/modules and print to a pretty unicode table.

## Installation

```
# npm install authorStats -g
```

## Usage

```
# authorStats <npm username>
```

Where `<npm username>` is the username on the NPM website. My profile is: `https://www.npmjs.com/~mrvautin` and username is `mrvautin`.

A nice command line table with the daily, weekly and monthly download numbers of all your packages will be output to your terminal.

Note: If you have a lot of packages you will need to be patient while `authorStats` fetches the data.
